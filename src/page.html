<h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
<p>Conway's Game of Life, also known as the Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician
    John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.</p>
<p>Conway's Game of Life consists of a square grid containing dead or alive cells. The behaviour of each cell is dependent on
    the state of its 8 immediate neighbours, according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ul>
